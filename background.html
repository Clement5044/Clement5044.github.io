    <p class="backgroundText">      Born in Luxembourg, I was raised in a family of 5, with two older sisters, a Spanish mother and a French father. Growing up in a intercultural family has enabled me to quickly learn and <br>
       become fluent in two language: French and Spanish. This exposure to languages at a young age spurred my desire to discover and learn new languages. This vision I had early on of <br>
       China's rise due to adults speaking about it at dinners made me want to learn Mandarin and so I did. At the age of 11 I started to learn this new language and have now reached an <br>
         understanding of it allowing me to communicate on a basic level with other individuals. This independence in following my interests also made me come to the decision to join a boarding <br>
          school in the UK at the age of 14 to perfect my English and finally be able to break away from my French accent.<br><br><br>
           Due to my father's profession, I was quickly immmersed into the financial world and I wanted to experience it for myself. To these ends, I decided to seek internship each time in different <br>
            sectors of this world. So far, I have been able to secure internships in Asset Management, Trading and Mergers and Acquisitions. In the future, I would potentially like to be an Intern in <br>
             Consulting or Ventures Capital before making my decision on which career path I would like to follow.<br><br><br>
    I decided to take this Information Management for Business BSc course at UCL because I realized that technology is becoming increasingly important in the business world and especially <br>
     when it comes to decision-making strategy and knowming how to code is becoming a very valuable asset when it comes to employment.<br><br>
